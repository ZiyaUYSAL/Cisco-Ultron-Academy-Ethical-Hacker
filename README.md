## Module 2: Planning and Scoping a Penetration Testing Assessment

### Regulatory Compliance Considerations
- [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/)
- [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)](https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/hipaa.html)

## Module 3: Information Gathering and Vulnerability Scanning

### Using OSINT Tools
- [OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com/)
- [WhatsMyName Web](https://whatsmyname.app/)
- [OSINT Combine](https://whatsmyname.app/)
- [SMART - Start Me Aggregated Resource Tool](https://smart.myosint.training/)
- **SpiderFoot** is an automated OSINT scanner
- **Recon-ng** is an OSINT framework that is similar to the Metasploit exploitation framework or the Social-Engineering Tooklit (SET)
- [Omar Santos GitHub Repository](https://github.com/The-Art-of-Hacking/h4cker/tree/master/osint)
- [WebSploit Labs](https://websploit.org/)
  
### DNS Lookups
- **DNSRecon Example -** $dnsrecon -d h4cker.org
- **Using Dig to Obtain Information About a Given Domain -** $dig h4cker.org
- **Obtaining the MX Record of h4cker.org -** $dig h4cker.org mx

### Identification of Technical and Administrative Contacts
- **Whois Information for the Domain h4cker.org -** $whois h4cker.org
- **Showing Technical and Administrative Email Contacts -** $whois cisco.com | grep '@cisco.com'

### Cloud vs. Self-Hosted Applications and Related Subdomains
- **DNS Name Resolution for netflix.com -** $host netflix.com
- **Example of the Ownership of IP Addresses and Applications Hosted in the Cloud-** $whois 3.230.129.93 | grep OrgName

### Cryptographic Flaws
- **The Digital Certificate Assigned to h4cker.org -** [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
- [Certificate Transparency](https://certificate.transparency.dev/)
